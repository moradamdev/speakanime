      <p>
        This is a website for people who wanna talk about anime with others. <br>
        It was originally made for discussing currently airing anime, but I've also added a random anime page. <br>
        Maybe one day there will be good RNG and you'll see one of your favorite shows. I'll probably also add my own favorite shows. <br>
      </p>
      <p>Every day at 5PM EST, Speakani.me checks to see if a new episode has aired and will make a new thread if one has aired.</p>
